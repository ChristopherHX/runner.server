## Fixes
- Use backslashs for paths in windows container 
- Serverurl is invalid for the oidc stub
- localcheckout emulation of v1 not working correctly
- `::add-path::` on windows with windows and linux container not working correctly
- Case sensitive env for linux container on windows
- Remove section handling from Runner.Client, since it was broken uncolored output
- Add filetable back to the templatecontext, workflow errors now includes filenames again
- Rework server send event, scope runner.client log. You no longer see foreign logs from other workflow runs
- webui faster loading of logs, due to a bug loading logs was delayed for one second
- Artifacts: files and name are case insensitive
- Artifacts: Merge previous uploaded artifacts and allow replacing existing files
- github app token now deleted after job finishs
- Artifacts: pseudo artifact container deleted after job finishs
- Artifacts: no longer create pseudo artifact container for reusable workflows
- owner and repository names are now caseinsensitive
- Improve entity framework context accesses and livetime management

## Features
- Update actions/runner to [v2.290.0](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.290.0)
- workflow_dispatch inputs context, based on [Github Feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/9092#discussioncomment-2453678) and [Issue Comment](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1483#issuecomment-1091025877)
  boolean workflow_dispatch values of the inputs context are actual booleans values like workflow_call inputs
- WEBUI Loading / error indicators

## Breaking Changes
- Enforce Workflow restrictions based on research of GitHub's limits
- localcheckout now uses node16 to download the repository from the server, since node12 reaches end of live on 30 April 2022
- Upgrade .net runtime to .net6, since .net5 reaches end of live on May 08, 2022

## Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## OSX x64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## [Pre-release] OSX arm64 (Apple silicon)

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-osx-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux x64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```
