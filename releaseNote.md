## Changes
- Failed workflows no longer creating a fake failing job
- Updated actions/runner to v2.285.1 + added node16 delay download
- Yaml Anchors support, hey this won't match github :) anyway. If you only use this runner you have composite actions with yaml anchors, but github would reject your workflow.
- Sleep 1s instead of 500ms after job finish to increase reliability.
  The runner ignores jobs, if the worker doesn't have enough time to exit after sending the job finish message. I count it as a runner bug, because the azure devops api doesn't have such a remote race condition.
- Fixed yaml type of workflow_call defaults and with
- Removed the need for owner/repo prefix from api ( old style url is still valid )
- More apis for webui WIP
- Refactored some duplicated code
- Cleanup TimeLine code
- Don't wait to display Queue logs till running
- Fix max-parallel of matrix to respect it on later batches
- Assign session.Job to the job instance of the queue
- Persistent Jobs, Logs, Artifacts and cache
- Advanced Reruns, rerun workflow, single job or failed jobs
- Artifacts and jobs from previos attempts are accessible from reruns
- Logs of workflow parsing in Runner.Client
- Logs of skipped jobs in Runner.Client
- Logs of matrix parsing
- Outputs of reusable workflows are now working

## Known Issues

- **TODO** Show workflow logs in webui see `<baseUrl>/#/owner` for a preview and logs of failed workflows, only relevant for selfhosting Runner.Server
  Runner.Client/gharun will show these logs in the Terminal
- **TODO** Manage Verbosity in more levels ideas are welcome, please open a discussion or issue
- **TODO** Persist workflow logs and not only job logs

## Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## OSX

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux x64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner.server/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```
